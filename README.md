# function 

**A JavaScript function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task.**


# JavaScript control flow statements.

 control flow statements are a fundamental part of any programming language, including JavaScript. They allow you to control the order in which statements are executed in your program, based on certain conditions or criteria.

In JavaScript, there are three main types of control flow statements:

- if/else statements
- switch statements
- loops.


**If/Else Statements**

   The if…else statement executes a block of code if a specified condition is true. If the condition is false, another block of code can be executed.

   **Switch Statements**

   Switch statements are used to execute a block of code based on the value of a variable or expression.

   **Loops**

   Loops are used to execute a block of code multiple times, based on a certain condition. There are two main types of loops in JavaScript: for loops and while loops.

   **While Loops**

   A while loop simply repeats itself while something is true. Theoretically a while loop can loop forever. It continues until the condition is false.

   **While and Do…While Loops**

   The while loop executes a specified statement as long as the test condition evaluates to true. The do…while loop will first execute the code, then continue while the condition remains true.
